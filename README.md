## Characteristics: Both datasets provide information about the ATS Standard Deviation for different characteristics of kidney transplant candidates. The characteristics include Overall, Donation Service Area, CPRA (Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody), Blood Type, Prior Kidney Transplant, Diagnosis, Age, Urban/Rural, Education, Gender, Insurance Type, Race/Ethnicity, BMI (Body Mass Index), Community Risk Score, and Citizenship
The "Overall Variability in Access-to-Transplant Score (ATS)" typically represents the average or overall level of variability in access across all waitlisted kidney candidates. It provides a general assessment of the fairness of the transplantation system in terms of granting access to deceased donor kidneys
The disparities in access to kidney transplants significantly decreased after the introduction of the Kidney Allocation System (KAS) in 2014. During this period, the overall variability in kidney transplant access, as measured by the Access-to-Transplant Score (ATS) standard deviation, decreased from approximately 1.69 to 1.29 Prior to KAS, there may have been unfairness in how kidneys were assigned to candidates. With the introduction of KAS, the goal was to make the allocation process more fair and equal by considering factors like medical urgency, compatibility, and waiting time. As a result, its indicating a more equal distribution of available organs among the candidates on the waiting list.

On the other hand, "Variability in Access-to-Transplant Scores (ATS) Among Waitlisted Kidney Candidates" refers to the specific range of ATS values observed among individual candidates on the waiting list. It highlights the differences in access and the potential disparities that exist among different individuals or subgroups.
These measures are important in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of transplantation policies and allocation systems in ensuring equitable access to kidney transplants for all eligible candidates, regardless of their demographic or medical characteristics.
The most noteworthy risk-adjusted differences in access to kidney transplants correspond to five key factors: • Donation service area, or DSA • Calculated panel reactive antibodies, or CPRA • Blood type • Prior kidney transplant • Diagnosis

## National Kidney Donors 
Overall Increasing Trend: Over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2022, there is an overall increasing trend in the number of National Kidney Donors. The data shows a positive percentage change (pct_chg) in most years, indicating a general upward trajectory. This suggests a growing willingness among individuals to donate kidneys and an increased awareness of the importance of organ donation.

## National Kidney Transplants
The number of national kidney transplants has generally shown an increasing trend over the years. From 1988 to 2022, the number of kidney transplants has consistently risen, indicating a positive trend in organ transplantation.
Although there may be some year-to-year variations, the overall trend exhibits steady growth. This suggests that efforts in organ donation and transplantation programs, advancements in medical technology, and increased awareness about kidney donation have contributed to a continuous rise in transplant procedures.
